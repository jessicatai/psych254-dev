You are the leader of a small army that consists of warriors from two tribes, the 
hill tribe and the river tribe.  You belong to neither tribe.  During the night a hill 
tribesman got into an argument with a river tribesman and murdered him.  The 
river tribe will attack the hill tribe unless the murderer is put to death, but the hill 
tribe refuses to kill one of its own warriors.<br />
The only way for you to avoid a war between the two tribes that will costs 
hundreds of lives is to publicly execute the murderer by cutting off is head with 
your sword.<br />
Is it appropriate for you to cut off this manâ€™s head in order to prevent the two 
tribes from fighting a war that will cost hundreds of lives?
